# Math-Word-Problem-Solver
Transformer based simple math word problem solver with very high accuracy trained on huge dataset

**MathBot.ipynb** : This is the main file to exectue and train the model

**RequiredFinal.ipynb** : This is a lightweight sub-code of MathBot.ipynb for the FrontEnd to execute

**FrontEnd.ipynb** : Running this will execute FrontEnd COde as well as the RequiredFinal Backend code.

**DataSet Pickle** : Contains totally 38,787 datapoints which includes manually added points.
